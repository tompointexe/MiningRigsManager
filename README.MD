# MiningRigsManager

MiningRigsManager is a web application and daemon designed to streamline the management of all your mining rigs while also providing quality of life features.

## Features

- **Centralized Management**: Manage all your mining rigs from one centralized dashboard, enabling you to monitor and control them efficiently.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Stay updated on the status of your rigs with key metrics such as hashrate, temperature, and power consumption.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Receive alerts and notifications for critical events such as downtime, temperature spikes, or hashrate drops, ensuring timely responses to potential issues.
- **Remote Control**: Remotely control your mining rigs, including starting, stopping, or rebooting them, all from the convenience of your web browser, and without the need of 3rd party servers (that oftenly needs to be payed)
- **Quality of Life Features**: Additional quality of life features that will be anounced later
